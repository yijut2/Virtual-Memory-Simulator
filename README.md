# Virtual-Memory-Simulator

WINTER 2020 ICS53-Lab3

You will implement a VM Simulator which will simulate the operation of a virtual memory system. To launch the system, your simulator will accept one optional command-line argument for the selection of the page replacement algorithm. The system will then accept commands to read/write from/to a virtual address space. Your system will need to correctly move pages between disk and main memory in order to satisfy access requests. Your system will need to properly maintain the page table as part of this process.
